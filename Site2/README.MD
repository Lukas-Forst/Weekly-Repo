# 🐧 Penguin Runner

A beautiful arctic endless runner game built with HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript. Guide a penguin through a snowy landscape, jumping over ice blocks while enjoying dynamic parallax scrolling and atmospheric effects.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Space Bar** or **Touch Screen**: Make the penguin jump
- **Objective**: Avoid ice block obstacles to keep running
- **Score**: Increases automatically as you survive longer
- **Game Over**: Press Space to restart after collision

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Classes & Systems

#### `MountainStrip` Class
Creates dynamic parallax mountain ranges with procedural generation.

```javascript
class MountainStrip {
    constructor(offset, speed, palette) {
        this.offset = offset;        // Starting X position
        this.speed = speed;          // Scroll velocity
        this.palette = palette;      // Color array
        this.peaks = Array.from({ length: 6 }, () => ({
            w: 120 + Math.random() * 80,  // Width variation
            h: 60 + Math.random() * 40    // Height variation
        }));
    }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Procedural generation**: Random mountain shapes for variety
- **Seamless wrapping**: Mountains loop infinitely without gaps
- **Snow caps**: Automatic white peaks on all mountains
- **Parallax scrolling**: Different layers move at different speeds

**Usage:**
- `backMountains`: Distant range (0.5x speed, light blue tints)
- `foreMountains`: Closer range (1.0x speed, darker blue tints)

### Core Game Functions

#### `drawRidge(ctx, y, amp)`
Renders subtle background hills using sine wave mathematics.
- Creates organic, rolling landscape silhouettes
- Provides additional atmospheric depth layer

#### `drawPenguin(ctx, y, state)`
Advanced character rendering with state-based animation and visual effects.

**Animation Features:**
- **Squash & stretch**: Landing compression for cartoon appeal
- **Dynamic wing flapping**: Sine wave animation during running
- **State-based poses**: Different animations for running/jumping/falling
- **Character tilt**: Realistic leaning during aerial maneuvers
- **Detailed design**: Anatomically correct penguin with proper colors

**Animation States:**
- `running`: Rhythmic wing flapping, subtle forward lean
- `jumping`: Wings positioned up, backward tilt for lift
- `falling`: Wings down for balance, forward lean

### Game Systems

#### Physics Engine
Realistic 2D physics simulation:
```javascript
const GRAVITY = 0.8;           // Constant downward acceleration
penguinVel += GRAVITY;         // Apply gravity each frame
penguinY += penguinVel;        // Update position
```

**Features:**
- **Realistic gravity**: Natural falling acceleration
- **Velocity-based movement**: Smooth parabolic jump arcs
- **Ground collision**: Proper landing detection and bounce prevention
- **State detection**: Physics-driven animation state changes

#### Parallax Scrolling System
Multi-layer depth simulation for immersive 3D feeling:
- **Background ridge**: Subtle rolling hills (static)
- **Back mountains**: Distant peaks (0.5x scroll speed)
- **Fore mountains**: Closer peaks (1.0x scroll speed)
- **Ground track**: Ice segments (2.0x scroll speed)

#### Particle System
Environmental atmosphere effects:
```javascript
const snowflakes = Array.from({ length: 20 }, () => ({
    x: Math.random() * 800,      // Random horizontal position
    y: Math.random() * -400,     // Start above screen
    speed: Math.random() * 2 + 1, // Varied fall speeds
    size: Math.random() * 3 + 2   // Different snowflake sizes
}));
```

**Features:**
- **Object recycling**: Snowflakes reset when off-screen
- **Natural variation**: Random sizes and speeds for realism
- **Performance optimized**: Efficient array-based particle management

#### Collision Detection
Precise rectangular overlap detection:
```javascript
if (60 > obstacleX && 40 < obstacleX + 20 &&     // X-axis overlap
    penguinY + 20 > 350 && penguinY < 370) {      // Y-axis overlap
    gameRunning = false;                           // Trigger game over
}
```

### Visual Design

#### Color Palette
Carefully crafted arctic atmosphere:
- **Sky gradient**: `#87CEEB` → `#F0F8FF` (sky blue to alice blue)
- **Mountain progression**: `#bcd3ff` → `#628cff` (atmospheric perspective)
- **Ice track**: `#e6f3ff` with `#b3d9ff` crack highlights
- **Penguin**: Classic black/white/orange Antarctic colors

#### Animation Techniques
- **RequestAnimationFrame**: Smooth 60fps professional rendering
- **Frame-based timing**: Sine wave calculations for organic motion
- **Visual feedback**: Squash animation and screen tint on collision
- **Mobile optimization**: Touch event handling for cross-platform play

## 🚀 Technical Features

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient rendering**: Minimal draw calls per frame
